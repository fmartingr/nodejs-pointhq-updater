# NodeJS PointHQ Updater
A simple script that get the public IP address from the current connection and send it to your [PointHQ](http://www.pointhq.com) account record you want to change.

**Rembmeber** You have to edit the ```CONFIG``` variable with your API credentials and record/zone IDs!

It's my very first Node script so feel free to facepalm yourself while sending me an email with your comments.
